ðŸ”¹ Splunk Interview Questions
Basic

What is Splunk?
Answer: Splunk is a platform for searching, monitoring, and analyzing machine-generated data (logs) in real time. It collects data via forwarders, indexes it, and provides dashboards and alerts.

What are the main components of Splunk?
Answer:

Forwarder: Sends logs to Splunk indexers.

Indexer: Indexes the incoming data and stores it.

Search Head: Provides UI to search, visualize, and analyze logs.

What is HEC in Splunk?
Answer: HTTP Event Collector (HEC) allows apps to send JSON events directly to Splunk via HTTP, enabling real-time log ingestion.




Intermediate

Explain Splunk Indexes.
Answer: An index is a repository where Splunk stores and organizes data for efficient searching. Indexes can be default (like main) or custom. Each index can have its own retention policy.

What is Splunk SPL?
Answer: Splunk Processing Language (SPL) is a query language used to search, analyze, and visualize logs. Example:

index=main sourcetype="apache_access" | stats count by status


Difference between Splunk Free, Enterprise, and Cloud.
Answer:

Free: 500 MB/day ingestion, no clustering.

Enterprise: Paid, unlimited ingestion, clustering, advanced features.

Cloud: SaaS version of Splunk, subscription-based.

How to monitor log performance in Splunk?
Answer: Using the Monitoring Console, you can check indexer performance, search performance, forwarder connectivity, and data ingestion metrics.

What are the types of Splunk Forwarders?
Answer:

Universal Forwarder (UF): Lightweight, only forwards raw logs.

Heavy Forwarder (HF): Can parse and index data before forwarding.

Explain Splunk Clustering.
Answer: Splunk supports Indexer Clustering for high availability and Search Head Clustering for scaling searches and dashboards across multiple nodes.

ðŸ”¹ ELK Stack Interview Questions
Basic

What is ELK Stack?
Answer: ELK Stack consists of:

Elasticsearch: Search and analytics engine.

Logstash: Data collection and processing pipeline.

Kibana: Visualization tool for dashboards.

Intermediate

What are Beats in ELK?
Answer: Beats are lightweight data shippers installed on servers to collect logs and send them to Logstash or Elasticsearch (e.g., Filebeat, Metricbeat).

What is an index in Elasticsearch?
Answer: An index is like a database in Elasticsearch. It stores documents with mappings and supports querying and analytics.

Difference between Elasticsearch and Logstash.
Answer:

Elasticsearch: Storage and search engine.

Logstash: Pipeline to ingest, parse, and transform data before sending to Elasticsearch.

Advanced

How to handle large-scale ELK deployments?
Answer:

Use Elasticsearch clusters with master, data, and client nodes.

Implement index lifecycle management (ILM) to manage data retention.

Use Kafka or Redis as a buffer between Logstash and Elasticsearch.

What is the difference between Logstash filters and Kibana visualizations?
Answer:

Filters: Transform, parse, or enrich data before indexing.

Visualizations: Represent indexed data in dashboards for analysis.

Explain ELK vs EFK.
Answer:

ELK: Elasticsearch + Logstash + Kibana.

EFK: Elasticsearch + Fluentd + Kibana (Fluentd replaces Logstash as log shipper)
